  # Explanation
  explanation_bac: Total budget allocated to the project.
  explanation_sac: This is the original planned completion duration (date) of the project.
  explanation_pv: Total cost of the work scheduled/planned as of a reporting date.
  explanation_ev: Total cost of the work completed/performed as of a reporting date. When the progress rate is set, recorded on change date.
  explanation_es: This duration from the beginning of the project to the date on which the PV should have been equal to the current value of EV.
  explanation_ac: Total cost taken to complete the work as of a reporting date.
  explanation_at: This is the duration from the beginning of the project to status date.
  explanation_sv: Positive Schedule Variance Indicates we are ahead of schedule. Negative Schedule Variance Indicates we are behind of schedule.
  explanation_cv: Positive Cost Variance Indicates the project is under budget. Negative Cost Variance Indicates the project is over budget.
  explanation_tv: If TV value is negative, the project is behind schedule and if it is positive, it is ahead of schedule.
  explanation_spi: Above 1 indicates project team is very efficient in utilizing the time allocated to the project. Below 1 indicates project team is less efficient in utilizing the time allocated to the project.
  explanation_cpi: Above 1 indicates efficiency in utilizing the resources allocated to the project is good. Below 1 indicates efficiency in utilizing the resources allocated to the project is not good.
  explanation_cr: Project performance. SPI * CPI
  explanation_tpi: Time performance index, If TPI is greater than 1, then the project is ahead of schedule and if it is less than 1, then the project is behind schedule.
  explanation_complete: The percentage of work which was planned to be completed by the Reporting Date.
  explanation_eac: Estimate At Completion (EAC) is the estimated cost of the project at the end of the project.
  explanation_teac: The remaining work will be performed while maintaining the same rate of doing work for the rest of the project
  explanation_etc: The estimated cost required to complete the remainder of the project. (BAC－EV) / CPI
  explanation_vac: The variance on the total budget at the end of the project. BAC－EAC
  explanation_tvac: The Time Variance at Completion (TVAC) gives an indication of the estimated amount of time that the project will be completed ahead or behind schedule
  explanation_difference_end_date: Difference of plan at the end of day and forecast end of day.
  explanation_tcpi: Showing the efficiency at which the resources on the project should be utilized for the remainder of the project.

  # Tooltips for EVM indicators
  tooltip_bac: "Budget At Completion (BAC): Total budget allocated to the project. This is the total planned value for the project."
  tooltip_complete_ev: "Complete EV: The percentage of work which has been completed by the reporting date, calculated as EV/BAC."
  tooltip_pv: "Planned Value (PV): Total cost of the work scheduled/planned as of the reporting date. Represents what should have been accomplished according to the plan."
  tooltip_ev: "Earned Value (EV): Total cost of the work completed/performed as of the reporting date. Represents the value of work actually completed."
  tooltip_ac: "Actual Cost (AC): Total cost taken to complete the work as of the reporting date. Represents what has been spent to achieve the current progress."
  tooltip_sv: "Schedule Variance (SV): Indicates whether the project is ahead or behind schedule. SV = EV - PV. Positive value means ahead of schedule, negative means behind schedule."
  tooltip_cv: "Cost Variance (CV): Indicates whether the project is under or over budget. CV = EV - AC. Positive value means under budget, negative means over budget."
  tooltip_spi: "Schedule Performance Index (SPI): Measures efficiency of time utilization. SPI = EV/PV. Value > 1 means ahead of schedule, < 1 means behind schedule."
  tooltip_cpi: "Cost Performance Index (CPI): Measures efficiency of cost utilization. CPI = EV/AC. Value > 1 means under budget, < 1 means over budget."
  tooltip_cr: "Critical Ratio (CR): Combined performance index. CR = SPI * CPI. Value > 1 means good performance, < 1 means poor performance."
  tooltip_eac: "Estimate At Completion (EAC): Estimated total cost of the project at completion based on current performance. EAC = AC + ETC."
  tooltip_etc: "Estimate To Complete (ETC): Estimated cost required to complete the remainder of the project. ETC = (BAC - EV) / CPI."
  tooltip_vac: "Variance At Completion (VAC): Indicates whether the project will finish under or over budget. VAC = BAC - EAC. Positive value means under budget, negative means over budget."
  tooltip_tcpi: "To Complete Performance Index (TCPI): Efficiency needed for the remainder of the project to achieve the budget goal. TCPI = (BAC - EV) / (BAC - AC)."
  
  # Tooltips for ES indicators
  tooltip_sac: "Schedule At Completion (SAC): The original planned completion duration (days) of the project."
  tooltip_es: "Earned Schedule (ES): The duration from the beginning of the project to the date on which the PV should have been equal to the current value of EV."
  tooltip_at: "Actual Time (AT): The duration from the beginning of the project to the status date."
  tooltip_tv: "Time Variance (TV): Indicates whether the project is ahead or behind schedule on a time basis. TV = ES - AT. Positive value means ahead of schedule, negative means behind schedule."
  tooltip_tpi: "Time Performance Index (TPI): Measures efficiency of time utilization based on earned schedule. TPI = ES/AT. Value > 1 means ahead of schedule, < 1 means behind schedule."
  tooltip_teac: "Time Estimate At Completion (TEAC): Estimated total duration of the project based on current time performance. TEAC = SAC / TPI."
  tooltip_tvac: "Time Variance At Completion (TVAC): Indicates whether the project will finish ahead or behind schedule. TVAC = SAC - TEAC. Positive value means ahead of schedule, negative means behind schedule."
